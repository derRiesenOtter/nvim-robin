# nvim-robin

My own neovim config - finally.

## TO-DO

Following things need to be done at some point:
- Latex Preview 
- get rid of some commands (e.g. "gt")
- get Spelling automatically to start for tex and md files (de, en)
- maybe find a better way to deal with terminals in nvim
- write a promt in llm.lua to comment code / write doc strings
- get "gw" to run every time I save a file (before the formatter)
